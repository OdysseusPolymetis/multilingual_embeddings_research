# multilingual_embeddings_research
Attempts for unsupervised multilingual word embeddings for Greek and Latin

This project contains several notebooks, each containing a (non-optimal) implementation for both [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) and [VecMap](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap) crosslingual word embeddings applied to Ancient Greek and French, using both GloVe and Word2Vec.
